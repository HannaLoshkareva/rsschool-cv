## About me:

Back in 2011, I received a librarian education, but I did not intend to be a librarian. I started studying web development back in 2017, but I didn’t have enough skills (first of all, knowledge of English) to enter the profession. Since then, I have been moving, albeit not very quickly, towards my goal of becoming a Frontend developer.

I like to work in a team, I find solutions for unsolvable (at first glance) tasks, I'm not afraid of difficulties, but I like to whine.

I believe that a person can learn everything if he really wants it.
